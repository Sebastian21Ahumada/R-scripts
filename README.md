# R-scripts

Welcome to my R Scripts repository! This repository contains personal projects and tasks completed using R, particularly focused on data visualization and web scraping. All the projects were made in R markdown, so you can find all the html reports generated as an output in the html folder, with the same name that the rmd file.

## birth_data_Chile.rmd
The objective of this exercise is to use the R markdown tool along with some of the most common R libraries, such as tidyverse and dplyr for data manipulation, and ggplot for data visualization. Two hypotheses are proposed and the aim is to confirm or refute them by manipulating and visualizing the data.

## WebScraping.rmd
The objective is to perform a web scraping exercise using R tools such as rvest to generate a dataset, which will then be used to conduct a small analysis.
